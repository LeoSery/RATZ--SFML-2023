## Presentation :

In this **Snake** made in **C++** with the **SFML** framework, you have to direct your **rat snake**, you have to go to the **cheeses** in order to eat them. If you eat a cheese, you **gain a rat** in your snake, if you bite yourself or collide with the walls, you lose.

The project includes a **web API** to manage **players' scores**. The **scoreboard** can be found in game or via [this URL](https://lesratz.fly.dev/scorelist).
